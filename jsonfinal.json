In addition to the capabilities of SystemC for modelling multi-processor HW/SW systems, the AMS extensions enable modelling the behaviour of analog/RF parts, physical environment and digital signal processing methods.The tutorial gives an introduction into SystemC AMS extensions. The introduction includes the language itself, some simple examples, use cases and (top-down) methodology for refinement of AMS systems, starting from an executable specification."

In reversible gates, there is a unique, one-to-one mapping between the inputs and outputs, not the case with conventional logic. In this tutorial, the speakers will introduce fundamentals of reversible logic and its promising applications in ultra-low power anocomputing, fault testing and emerging nanotechnologies, as well as the current state of the art and challenges in future. In this presentation, first, a brief overview of reversible logic basics will be given. Next, the speakers will introduce basic reversible logic gates and the key metrics that need to be optimized in reversible logic design and synthesis. Reversible gates require constant ancilla inputs for reconfiguration of gate functions and garbage outputs that help in keeping reversibility. Thus, it is important to minimize parameters such as ancilla and garbage bits, quantum cost and delay in the design of reversible circuits. Next, the speakers will introduce a number of basic reversible gates used in design and a new reversible gate namely the TR gate (Thapliyal-Ranganathan) which has the unique structure that makes it ideal for the realization of arithmetic circuits such as adders, subtractors and comparators,   efficient in terms of the parameters such as ancilla and garbage bits, quantum cost and delay. The design methodologies and a framework to synthesize reversible data path functional units, such as binary and BCD adders, subtractors, barrel shifters,   binary comparators and floating point units will be presented.The objective behind the proposed design methodologies is to synthesize arithmetic and logic functional units optimizing key metrics such as ancilla inputs, garbage outputs, quantum cost and delay. Next, the speakers will present a set of methodologies for the design of reversible sequential circuits such as reversible latches, flip-flops and shift registers. Next, the application of reversible logic in online and offline testing of single as well as multiple faults in traditional and reversible nanoscale VLSI circuits is introduced. As reversible logic has applications in various emerging technologies such as quantum computing, quantum dot cellular automata, optical computing etc, thus this tutorial will also cover the introductory material on these emerging nanotechnologies. A brief overview will be presented of the design of low power circuits based on reversible computing paradigm such as split charge recovery logic (SCRL), reversible energy recovery logic (RERL), nmos reversible energy recovery logic (nRERL), r-MOS, etc. The tutorial will conclude with discussions on current state of the art, progress and future challenges, such as reversible programming languages, design of reversible CPU, and the open questions about the implementation technologies that could pave the way of ultra-low power nano-processor. In conclusion, this tutorial will touch on reversible logic having application in traditional CMOS for low power computing to non-classical computing domain such as quantum computing, QCA computing. etc."

          "abs": "Abstract: Semiconductor yield has traditionally been limited by random particle-defect based issues. However, as the feature sizes reduced to 90nm and below, systematic mechanism-limited yield loss began to appear as a substantial component in yield loss. In addition, it is becoming clear that ramping yield would take longer and final yields would not reach historical norms. A key factor for not reaching previously attained yield levels is the interaction between design and manufacturing. Yield losses in the newer processes include functional defects, parametric defects and   issues with testing. Each of these sources of yield loss needs to be analyzed and understood by designers and tool developers. In addition, new techniques and methods must be devised to minimize the impact of these yield loss mechanisms. After an introduction of the issues involved in the first section, the second section covers Design-for-Manufacturing (DFM) techniques to analyze the design content, flag areas of design that could limit yield, and make changes to improve yield. However, once the changes are made it is necessary to quantify their impact so that knowledge about yield contribution of different features can be fed back to design   and DFM tools. Test presents an opportunity to close the loop by crafting test patterns to expose the defect prone features during automatic test pattern generation (ATPG) and by analyzing silicon failures through diagnosis to determine the features that are actually causing yield loss and their relative impact. The third section covers design techniques (DFX) to improve testability, debuggability and diagnosability, and DFM and defect-aware test generation to both meet product quality and expose yield issues at test. Section four covers the basic concepts and theoretical aspects of debug and diagnosis including algorithmic IC diagnosis, scan   chain diagnosis, critical path based techniques and diagnosis of delay defects. The applications of the basic concepts and techniques for silicon debug are covered in section five. Section six covers the application of statistical diagnosis techniques to   determine the features that are actually causing yield loss and their relative impact. Finally, in section seven, future trends, challenges and directions are covered.The proposed tutorial includes the basics to be of interest to students, new engineers and managers but covers new and recent advances in hot topics in Design-for-Manufacturing, yield, test and diagnosis to be of interest to researchers and practicing engineers. The selection of topics cover a broad spectrum and will be of interest to a wide audience including design, test, product, validation, yield, debug and FA engineers."

Electronic description of VLSI design being an intellectual property (IP), may be infringed upon during design reuse. This calls for incorporating techniques for intellectual property protection in the VLSI design flow. The IP of VLSI design, which culminates in fabrication of the integrated circuit, differs from other sources of IPs   because in addition to its physical and structural description, it has also a behavioral specification which should remain unaltered after application of IP protection techniques. Security in activation of chips, especially in embedded systems, is an equally grave issue and has led to the paradigm of design-for-security.This tutorial aims at presenting the major concerns related to IP security that are significant to both the circuit designers and developers of CAD tools. The nature of threats are broadly categorized as (i) misappropriation by hacking during electronic commerce and intentional reselling mostly at design level, and (ii) unauthorized design retrieval. Various attack models and the mechanisms for effective counter measures such as encryption, obfuscation, watermarking and fingerprinting, and certain analytic methods derived from the behavioral aspect, specific to chip designs, will be discussed.

          "abs": "Abstract: This tutorial begins with a broad overview of challenges in emerging mixed signal systems. After describing the system-level requirements along with the architecture and circuit needs, specific circuit and system solutions will be discussed to highlight promising approaches. Design techniques for advanced analog- and mixed signal circuit blocks such as phase-locked loops and analog-to-digital converters will be covered   in detail. Finally, the modeling and analysis of substrate noise coupling in mixed-signal integrated circuits is addressed. Detailed program: This day long tutorial addresses both the system- and circuit-level aspects of emerging mixed-signal systems. Analysis and design techniques to implement analog to digital converters, phase-locked loops, and the impact of substrate noise on these circuits in large system-on-chips will be discussed. The tutorial is categorized into the following four categories.  1. Challenges in Emerging Mixed-Signal Systems and Applications: With the successful integration of systems-on-a-chip for a wide range of ubiquitous applications including cell phones and gaming devices, new applications for SOCs are arising that create unique challenges at the circuit and system level. In this talk several emerging applications for integrated mixed-signal systems will be highlighted including sensor networks, solar electronics, and tracking and monitoring devices. The system level requirements will be discussed along with the architecture and circuit needs. Specific circuit and system solutions will be discussed to highlight promising approaches to address both application and process challenges in the coming decade.  2. Phase-Locking Techniques for Frequency Synthesis: Phase-locked loops (PLLs) are essential building blocks in all digital, analog, and radiofrequency integrated circuits (ICs). The noise, power, and area of PLLs determine many of the key performance parameters in all such ICs. This tutorial describes the fundamental principles and concepts of PLL design. After reviewing the operation of a simple type-1 PLL and the characteristics of its building blocks, the operating and design principles of a charge-pump PLL will be discussed in detail. Phase noise analysis using a small-signal model will be described and noise-bandwidth-power tradeoffs will be presented. Existing and emerging techniques to alleviate these tradeoffs will be briefly discussed.  3. Digitally-Enhanced Phase-Locking Techniques: Implementing analog phase-locked loops (PLLs) in deep sub-micron processes pose many design challenges. In this talk we elucidate such challenges and address those using highly digital architectures. Implementation details of the building blocks in a digital PLL such as time-to-digital converters, digital loop filters, and digitally-controlled oscillators will be described. Digital PLL specific design issues such as limit cycles and the dither   jitter caused by them will be discussed.  4. Advanced and Emerging ADCs: Many analog IC designers and students are drawn to ADCs. While some ADC realizations have had a lasting impact, examples including pipelined ADCs with digital redundancy, flash ADCs with folding and interpolation, and multi-bit delta-sigma modulators with dynamic element matching, there are many more recent, advanced and emerging ADC design techniques that are receiving much attention and also gaining momentum in some areas. Many of these ideas are showered with doubts and honest criticism. However, we may also be entering a new era where some of these developments would help resolve the toughest submicron scaling challenges that analog designers face today. This tutorial will summarize and ponder the impact of a few selective as well as random   slices of these advanced and emerging ADC designs."

          "abs": "Abstract: As semiconductor manufacturers build ever smaller components, circuits and chips at the nano scale become less reliable and more expensive to produce ¬ñ no longer behaving like precisely chiseled machines with tight tolerances. Modern computing tends to ignore the variability in behavior of underlying system components from device to device, their wear-out over time, or the environment in which the computing system is placed. This makes them expensive, fragile and vulnerable to even the smallest changes in the environment or component failures. This tutorial presents an approach to tame and exploit variability through a strategy where system components -- led by proactive software -- routinely monitor, predict and adapt to the variability of manufactured systems. Unlike conventional system design where variability is hidden behind the conservative specifications of an ¬ìover-designed¬î hardware, we describe strategies that expose spatiotemporal variations in hardware to the highest layers of software. After presenting the background and positioning the new approach, the tutorial will proceed in a bottom-up fashion. Causes of variability at the circuit and hardware levels are first presented, and classical approaches to hide such variability are presented. The tutorial then presents a number of strategies at successively higher levels of abstraction ¬ñ covering the circuit, microarchitecture, compiler, operating systems and software applications ¬ñ to monitor, detect, adapt to, and exploit the exposed variability. Adaptable software will use online statistical modeling to learn and predict actual hardware characteristics, opportunistically adjust to variability, and proactively conform to a deliberately underdesigned hardware with relaxed design and manufacturing constraints. The resulting class of UnO (Underdesigned and Opportunistic) computing machines are adaptive but highly energy efficient. They will continue working while using components that vary in performance or grow less reliable over time and across technology generations. A fluid software-hardware interface will mitigate the variability of manufactured systems and make machines robust, reliable and responsive to changing operating conditions --offering the best hope for perpetuating the fundamental gains in computing performance at lower cost of the past 40 years."

The latest advancements in 3D Integration of IC dies have only aggravated this problem, creating a strong worldwide research interest in the   development of advanced cooling technologies, such as interlayer microchannel liquid cooled heat sinks, to maintain ICs under safe operating temperatures. While this research has helped create a substantial amount of knowledge base pertaining to the heat transfer mechanism in advanced liquid cooling systems as applied to electronic circuits, this knowledge is yet to be transferred to the EDA community for it to be incorporated in the IC thermal simulators of the future. The existence of such tools becomes absolutely essential when IC designers are faced with the challenge of ascertaining the thermal reliability of their designs in the presence of   liquid cooling systems. This tutorial aims to introduce the attendees to the key concepts that are needed to compute IC temperatures with and without microchannel liquid cooling and the principles behind compact modeling of forced convective heat transfer in advanced IC cooling technologies. A major part of this tutorial is based on the 3D- -ICE thermal simulator, which has been built by the   Embedded Systems Laboratory in EPFL, Switzerland (URL:http://esl.epfl.ch/3D-¬≠-ICE ). This simulator is based on the Compact Transient   Thermal Modeling for forced convective cooling advanced by our research group. Since its release in 2010, more than 50 research groups across the world have downloaded it and are actively using it for their research."

This expansion creates a new set of challenges: engineers now face exponentially growing verification performance and capacity issues. It is no longer enough to write constraints that simply function to validate a design. Today, engineers must also optimize the constraints they write for performance if they wish to have any hope of both successfully validating their design and meeting their deadlines. In this tutorial, we discuss a scalable methodology for writing constraints and optimizing performance is which will improve engineers√ï productivity to write and debug ever-increasing amounts of larger, more complex sets of constraints. Our goal is to reduce the time needed for functional convergence, and later for debug and volume manufacturing. We will also discuss the vital role of Verification IP providers and users in this scenario."
